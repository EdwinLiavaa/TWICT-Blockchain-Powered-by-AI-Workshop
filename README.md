# TWICT-Blockchain-Powered-by-AI-Workshop

## About

Malo e Lelei and welcome! I'm excited to lead this groundbreaking 1st Blockchain Introductory Workshop powered by AI for Tongan Nationals, hosted by the pioneering Tongan Women in ICT (TWICT).

Blockchain technology has immense potential to transform economies and societies around the world. However, there are still significant gaps in blockchain understanding and adoption, especially among women and marginalized groups.

This workshop is a crucial first step in promoting blockchain advocacy and awareness in Tonga. By empowering Tongans with blockchain literacy, we can lay the foundation for inclusive innovation and sustainable development.

Blockchain enables transparent, secure digital transactions without intermediaries. It can expand financial access, boost efficiency in business and governance, and create new economic opportunities. With the right knowledge, Tongans can leverage blockchain to solve local challenges and improve livelihoods.

We have an opportunity today to shape an equitable blockchain future in the Pacific by equipping Tongan changemakers with the tools to drive adoption. This workshop also highlights the power of women in technology to open doors for the next generation of leaders in Tonga.

I'm honored to facilitate this pioneering workshop and I'm excited to explore blockchain's possibilities in Tonga together! Let's get started!
